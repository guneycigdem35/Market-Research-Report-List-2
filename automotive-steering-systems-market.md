<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Steering Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EPS</li><li>HPS</li><li>EHPS</li><li>MS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive Steering Systems can be categorized into four main types: Electric Power Steering (EPS), Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS), Electro-Hydraulic Power Steering (EHPS), and Manual Steering (MS). EPS uses an electric motor to assist with steering, resulting in improved fuel efficiency and easier handling. HPS uses hydraulic fluid to amplify steering force, while EHPS combines electric and hydraulic systems for enhanced performance. Manual Steering requires the driver to provide all the steering force without assistance from any power sources. Each type has its own advantages and applications in the automotive industry.</p></p>
