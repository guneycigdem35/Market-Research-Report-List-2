<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dry Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive</li><li>Negative</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dry film photoresists are widely used in the electronics industry for manufacturing printed circuit boards. There are two main types of dry film photoresist: positive and negative. Positive photoresists become more soluble when exposed to light, allowing the unexposed areas to be developed away. Negative photoresists, on the other hand, become less soluble when exposed to light, creating a protective layer that remains after development. Both types offer unique advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
