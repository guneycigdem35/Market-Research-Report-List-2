<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Hydraulic Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piston</li><li>Positive-Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electric hydraulic pumps come in two main types: piston and positive-displacement pumps. Piston pumps operate by drawing fluid into a chamber through the action of pistons, while positive-displacement pumps use rotating gears, screws, or vanes to push fluid through. Piston pumps are known for their high efficiency and precise control, making them ideal for applications requiring high pressure and accuracy. Positive-displacement pumps, on the other hand, are better suited for handling a wide range of viscosities and maintaining a constant flow rate.</p></p>
