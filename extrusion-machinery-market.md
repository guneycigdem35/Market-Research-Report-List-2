<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extrusion Machinery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Screw Extrusion</li><li>Twin Screw Extrusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extrusion machinery is categorized into two main types based on the number of screws used - single screw extrusion and twin screw extrusion. Single screw extrusion involves a single rotating screw that forces material through a die to create a desired shape. On the other hand, twin screw extrusion employs two screws that work in tandem to mix, heat, and transport materials through the machine. Each type has its own advantages and is utilized in different industries based on the specific requirements of the production process.</p></p>
