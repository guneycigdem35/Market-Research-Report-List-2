<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flexible Couplings</li><li>Rigid Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial couplings market can be divided into two main types: Flexible couplings and Rigid couplings. Flexible couplings are designed to accommodate misalignment between shafts and provide vibration dampening, making them ideal for applications where flexibility is required, such as in pumps or motors. On the other hand, Rigid couplings do not allow for any misalignment and provide a direct, solid connection between shafts, making them suitable for high precision applications like in machine tools. Both types play a crucial role in connecting rotating shafts in various industrial applications.</p></p>
