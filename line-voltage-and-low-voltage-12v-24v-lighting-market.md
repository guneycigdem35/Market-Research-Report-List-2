<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Line Voltage and Low Voltage (12v & 24v) Lighting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Line Voltage Lighting</li><li>Low Voltage (12v/ 24v) Lighting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Line voltage lighting refers to lighting systems that operate directly at the standard voltage of a building, typically 120V. This type of lighting is commonly found in residential and commercial spaces. On the other hand, low voltage lighting operates at either 12V or 24V, requiring a transformer to step down the voltage from the standard line voltage. Low voltage lighting is popular for outdoor landscapes and gardens, as well as for accent lighting in homes and businesses due to its energy efficiency and versatility.</p></p>
