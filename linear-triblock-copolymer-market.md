<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Triblock Copolymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Anionic Polymerization</li><li>Inactive Anionic Polymerization</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Linear triblock copolymer market can be classified into two types based on the polymerization process: active anionic polymerization and inactive anionic polymerization. In active anionic polymerization, the polymer chain growth occurs through the use of living anionic initiators, allowing for precise control over the polymer structure and properties. In contrast, inactive anionic polymerization involves the use of conventional initiators, resulting in less control over the polymer structure. Both processes have their own advantages and applications in the development of linear triblock copolymers.</p></p>
