<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Battery Copper Foil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electrolytic Copper Foil</li><li>Rolled Copper Foil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lithium Battery Copper Foil is available in two main types: Electrolytic Copper Foil and Rolled Copper Foil. Electrolytic Copper Foil is produced by electroplating pure copper onto a metal sheet, resulting in a smooth and uniform foil with high conductivity. On the other hand, Rolled Copper Foil is made by rolling copper ingots between high-pressure rollers, creating a thinner and more flexible foil. Both types of copper foil are essential components in lithium batteries, providing a stable and conductive surface for the electrodes.</p></p>
