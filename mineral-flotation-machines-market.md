<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mineral Flotation Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pneumatic Machines</li><li>Mechanical Machines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mineral flotation machines are commonly classified into pneumatic machines and mechanical machines based on their operating principles. Pneumatic machines rely on air flow to create bubbles that carry the mineral particles to the surface for recovery. On the other hand, mechanical machines use impellers to agitate the water and create a froth layer where the mineral particles attach and are collected. Both types of machines are widely used in the mining industry for separating valuable minerals from gangue materials.</p></p>
