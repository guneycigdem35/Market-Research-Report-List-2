<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Oil-Based Polyol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyether Polyols</li><li>Polyester Polyols</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural Oil-Based Polyol Market types include Polyether Polyols and Polyester Polyols. Polyether Polyols are derived from the reaction of natural oil-based mono or polyfunctional alcohols with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or a combination of both. They offer good flexibility and low temperature properties, making them suitable for applications such as coatings, adhesives, and rigid foams. On the other hand, Polyester Polyols are produced by reacting natural oil-based diacids or anhydrides with natural oil-based diols, offering high tensile strength and resistance to hydrolysis, making them ideal for applications in coatings, adhesives, and flexible foams.</p></p>
