<p><p>Ossicular Replacement Prostheses (ORPs) are devices used in middle ear surgery to replace damaged or missing ossicles. There are two main types of ORPs: Partial Ossicular Replacement Prostheses (PORP) and Total Ossicular Replacement Prostheses (TORP). PORPs are used to replace one or more ossicles in cases where only a portion of the ossicular chain is damaged. TORPs are used when the entire ossicular chain is damaged and need to be replaced. Both types of ORPs help improve hearing by restoring the function of the middle ear.</p></p>
