<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photo-electric Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through-beam Sensors</li><li>Retro-reflective Sensors</li><li>Diffuse-reflective Sensors</li><li>Other Types</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photo-electric sensors are widely categorized into four main types: Through-beam sensors, Retro-reflective sensors, Diffuse-reflective sensors, and Other types. Through-beam sensors consist of separate emitter and receiver units that detect when an object interrupts the light beam. Retro-reflective sensors have a built-in reflector that bounces light back to the sensor for detection. Diffuse-reflective sensors detect objects by reflecting light off the target itself. Other types of photo-electric sensors include background suppression sensors, clear object detection sensors, and color mark sensors, each offering unique functionalities in various industrial applications.</p></p>
