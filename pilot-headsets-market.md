<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pilot Headsets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNR headsets</li><li>ANR headsets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pilot headsets market is divided into two main types: PNR (passive noise reduction) headsets and ANR (active noise reduction) headsets. PNR headsets use padding and insulation to block out external noise, while ANR headsets use technology to actively cancel out noise. PNR headsets are more affordable but may not provide as much noise reduction as ANR headsets, which are typically more expensive. Both types are popular among pilots for their ability to enhance communication and reduce fatigue during flights.</p></p>
