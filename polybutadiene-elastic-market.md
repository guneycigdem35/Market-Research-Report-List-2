<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polybutadiene Elastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Cis</li><li>Low Cis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polybutadiene elastic is classified into two types based on the percentage of cis isomer in the polymer chain â€“ High Cis and Low Cis. High Cis polybutadiene contains a higher percentage of cis isomers, which results in increased elasticity, flexibility, and resistance to heat and chemicals. Low Cis polybutadiene, on the other hand, contains a lower percentage of cis isomers, making it less elastic and more rigid. Both types have their own distinct properties and applications in various industries.</p></p>
