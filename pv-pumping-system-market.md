<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PV Pumping System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible</li><li>Surface Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PV pumping systems are divided into two main types: submersible and surface pumps. Submersible pumps are installed underwater and are ideal for deep well applications, while surface pumps are placed above ground and are better suited for shallow well pumping. Submersible pumps have higher efficiency and require less maintenance, making them more suitable for larger-scale agricultural and industrial applications. Surface pumps, on the other hand, are simpler to install and maintain, making them more cost-effective for smaller-scale residential and commercial uses.</p></p>
