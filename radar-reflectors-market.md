<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radar Reflectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Octahedral Corner Reflector</li><li>Luneberg Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radar reflectors are devices used to enhance the visibility of objects on radar systems. The octahedral corner reflector is a type of radar reflector that consists of three mutually perpendicular conducting plates. It reflects radar signals back towards the source, making the object more detectable. On the other hand, Luneberg lens radar reflectors use a special lens design to focus incoming radar signals, increasing the reflectivity of the object. Both types of radar reflectors are effective in improving the visibility of objects on radar systems.</p></p>
