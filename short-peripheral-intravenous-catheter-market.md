<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ported Short PIVC</li><li>Non-Ported Short PIVC</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ported Short Peripheral Intravenous Catheters (PIVC) have an additional port on the catheter hub for administration of secondary medications or fluids without the need for an additional needle insertion. Non-Ported Short PIVCs do not have this additional port and only allow for the infusion of one medication or fluid at a time. Both types of PIVCs are commonly used in healthcare settings for short-term venous access, but the choice between ported and non-ported depends on the specific needs of the patient and clinical situation.</p></p>
