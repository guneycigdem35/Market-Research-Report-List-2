<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Strain Gauge Converters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Current Output</li><li>Voltage Output</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Strain gauge converters can be categorized into two main types: current output and voltage output. Current output converters provide a current signal that is proportional to the applied strain, making them suitable for applications where long wiring distances are required. On the other hand, voltage output converters produce a voltage signal that varies with the applied strain, making them more convenient for connecting to standard measurement equipment. Both types offer flexibility and accuracy in converting strain gauge signals for various industrial and scientific applications.</p></p>
