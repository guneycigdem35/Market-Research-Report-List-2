<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thoracic Vascular Stent Grafts Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plastic Thoracic Vascular Stent Grafts</li><li>Metal Thoracic Vascular Stent Grafts</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thoracic vascular stent grafts are used to treat thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. There are two main types of thoracic vascular stent grafts: plastic and metal. Plastic stent grafts are made of a flexible polymer material, while metal stent grafts are made of a self-expandable metal mesh. Both types are designed to provide support and reinforcement to the weakened aortic wall, preventing further expansion or rupture of the aneurysm. The choice between plastic and metal stent grafts depends on the patient's specific condition and the physician's preference.</p></p>
