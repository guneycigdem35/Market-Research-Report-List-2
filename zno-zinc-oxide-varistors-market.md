<p><strong>The ZnO (Zinc Oxide) Varistors Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer Metal Oxide Lightning Arrester</li><li>Porcelain Metal Oxide Lightning Arrester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ZnO (Zinc Oxide) varistors are commonly used in both polymer and porcelain metal oxide lightning arresters to protect electrical systems from voltage surges caused by lightning strikes or other transient events. The varistors in these arresters provide a high resistance under normal conditions, but quickly transition to a low resistance state when a surge occurs, diverting the excess energy away from sensitive equipment. This helps prevent damage and downtime in electrical systems, making ZnO varistors an essential component in lightning protection technology.</p></p>
